# Star Trek Inspired VR Game

This project was devleoped as part of my Computer Graphics course at UBC (CPSC 314). The basis of this game is to destroy the Borg cubes that appear. Note this game was devloped to work with an iPhone 7 and may not function properly on other devices. This game was based on the WebVR boiler plate (See notes below).

# Current State 
Since the objective of this project was to learn more about 3D computer graphics, the focus on this project was on the graphics and not the game logic. Therefore, a new enemy appears everytime you fire and there is no way to win.

# WebVR Boilerplate

A [THREE.js][three]-based starting point for cross-platform web-based VR
experiences.

This project relies heavily on the [WebVR Polyfill][polyfill] to provide VR
support if the [WebVR API][spec] is not implemented. It also uses the [WebVR
UI][ui] project to render the UI to enter VR and magic window modes. See here
for a [live demo][demo].
